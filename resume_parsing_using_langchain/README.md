# FastAPI Resume Processor

This project is a FastAPI application that extracts key information from PDF resumes using the Langchain framework and Google Generative AI. The application takes a PDF file, processes it, and returns the extracted details in JSON format.

## Features

- Load PDF resumes using the `PyPDFLoader`.
- Extract essential information such as name, email, contact number, education details, skills, and more.
- Basic authentication for accessing the API.
- JSON response format for easy integration and usability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Langchain Community
- Langchain Google Generative AI
- Python-dotenv

## Environment Variables

Before running the application, you need to set the following environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project directory or export them in your environment.

GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key> API_USERNAME=<your_api_username> API_PASSWORD=<your_api_password>

bash


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd your-repo-name

    Install the required packages:

    bash

    pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv langchain langchain-google-genai langchain-community jsons

Usage

    Add Your PDF Resume: Place the PDF resume you want to process in a known directory. Update the resume_file_path variable in main.py with the correct path to your PDF file.

    Run the Application:

    bash

uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5001

Access the API: Open your web browser or use a tool like Postman to send a GET request to the root endpoint.

arduino

    GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/

    You will need to provide basic authentication using the credentials specified in your environment variables.

    View Extracted Details: Upon successful authentication, the application will load the resume, extract the relevant fields, and return them in JSON format.

Example of JSON Response

Hereâ€™s what the extracted details might look like in JSON format:

json

{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "contact_number": "+123456789",
